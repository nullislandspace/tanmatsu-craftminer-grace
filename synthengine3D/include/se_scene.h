//  SynthEngine3D  --  PUBLIC STABLE API  --  3D scene pipeline
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  The software 3D renderer: a per-pixel z-buffered rasterizer plus the
//  pinhole camera + projection it draws through. Games submit world-space
//  triangles / wireframe edges; the engine projects, depth-tests and
//  rasterizes them. The engine knows nothing about game objects — the
//  game iterates its own world and calls scene_tri / scene_line. Part of
//  the versioned public surface (see se_version.h); projection constants
//  are overridable defaults in se_config.h.
// =====================================================================

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "se_config.h"   // RENDER_* projection params (overridable)
#include "se_texture.h"  // se_texture_t (scene_textured_tri)

// Depth-buffered 3D scene pipeline.
//
// Replaces the old per-object painter's algorithm in render.c. Every
// 3D object (obstacles, the ship) submits its geometry as world-space
// triangles and wireframe edges; the scene module projects it, depth-
// tests it per pixel against a z-buffer, and rasterizes it. Draw order
// no longer matters — the depth test resolves visibility, so objects
// can be submitted in any order and the result is per-pixel correct
// (stacked, straddling and interpenetrating geometry all just work).
//
// Depth is stored as a scaled reciprocal-z: larger value = nearer.
// The depth buffer is never bulk-cleared: a parallel per-pixel frame
// stamp marks which depths belong to the current frame, so a stale
// pixel reads as infinitely far and scene_begin costs one counter
// increment instead of a full-screen memset.
//
// Deferred submission (ER): scene_tri / scene_line do NOT draw on call.
// They project the world-space geometry with the current camera and
// accumulate it into per-frame triangle / edge lists. scene_render()
// then rasterizes the whole frame at once: triangles first (per-pixel
// z-tested, so their order is irrelevant), then wireframe edges (z-tested
// with a small bias so an edge wins against the coplanar face it outlines
// but still loses to genuinely nearer geometry). Holding the whole frame
// lets the engine own the algorithm (z-buffer today; painter's / sorted /
// tiled later) and cull + order the geometry centrally against the FOV /
// resolution — without any game call site changing. Those cull + order
// passes (se_scene_options_t / scene_set_options) are opt-in and default
// OFF, so the renderer is byte-identical to the old hybrid-immediate
// pipeline until a game enables them.

// Which algorithm scene_render() uses to resolve the frame. Selected per
// call, so a game can switch renderers live (between frames) or pick a
// different one per screen.
//
//   SE_RENDER_ZBUFFER  walks triangles, and for each one walks the pixels
//                      it covers, depth-testing per pixel. Cost scales
//                      with the summed triangle AREA, i.e. covered pixels
//                      x overdraw. The depth plane (and the framebuffer)
//                      are in PSRAM at full resolution.
//
// It is the only built-in. Two others were tried and removed, both under
// 2.2: a tiled primary-ray raycaster, which no game ever rendered with,
// and SE_RENDER_BANDED, which drew the z-buffer's passes one band of
// columns at a time in internal SRAM. Banding was 1.6x faster at full
// resolution but 8% SLOWER at quarter resolution, where a game that
// wants the frame rate actually runs and where the depth plane is
// already in SRAM; its band buffers could not be widened past 32 columns
// on a P4 (internal SRAM is too fragmented for two 60 KB blocks), so the
// gap could not be closed, and it cost 60 KB that scarcer things want.
// See the CHANGELOG, and SynthMiner's claudeplans/synthminer.md G6 for
// the measurements.

// --- Quarter-resolution rendering ------------------------------------
//
// scene_set_render_scale(2) renders the next frames at half the width
// and half the height -- a quarter of the pixels, so about a quarter of
// the rasterizing, which is what a fill-bound scene pays for. Nothing
// else changes: the camera, the RENDER_* projection, the viewport (still
// given in full-screen pixels), culling, clipping and lighting all work
// in full-screen coordinates as before. Only the projected positions
// are halved, so the target's pixel (i, j) is exactly what full
// resolution would draw at (2i, 2j) -- every other pixel of every other
// line, packed without the gaps.
//
// The fb given to scene_begin() must then be a buffer of
// DISPLAY_LOG_W/2 x DISPLAY_LOG_H/2 logical pixels in the display's
// format and orientation (e.g. an se_ppa_layer_t allocated that size),
// which the game scales up onto the screen afterwards
// (se_ppa_blit_scaled). Lines and points stay one target pixel wide, so
// two screen pixels. Switch freely between frames: the scale is
// latched by scene_begin(). 1 (the default) is full resolution; any
// other value than 2 means 1.

// --- Triangle flags ---------------------------------------------------
//
// A bit mask passed with every triangle, flat or textured. 0 is the
// plain triangle: depth-tested, and lit if a light is set. Bits not
// defined here are reserved -- pass them as 0, so that a later engine
// can give them a meaning without changing what existing calls do.
//
//   SE_TRI_EMISSIVE  Never lit: the triangle keeps the exact colour (or
//                    texels) it was given, at full strength, whatever
//                    se_light_set() says. For things that give off light
//                    rather than reflect it -- engine flames, lamps,
//                    screens -- and for geometry the game has already
//                    shaded itself. It costs less than a lit triangle,
//                    since the per-face normal is skipped too.
#define SE_TRI_EMISSIVE  (1u << 0)

//   SE_TRI_LIGHT(n)  A light level from the GAME, 0..32 (32 = full),
//                    multiplied into whatever shade the triangle ends up
//                    with -- the se_light shade for a lit triangle, full
//                    strength for an emissive one. For light the engine
//                    cannot know about: a torch in a cave, the fall of
//                    night on a block world, anything the game worked
//                    out per face itself. Carried in bits 8..13 as the
//                    DARKNESS (32 - n), so a flags value without it --
//                    every call written before it existed -- means full
//                    light and draws exactly as before. (Since 2.1.)

// --- Tinting everything drawn ----------------------------------------
//
// Scale the RED AND GREEN of every triangle by `rg` and the BLUE by `b`,
// both 0..SE_TRI_LIGHT_MAX where 32 leaves the colour alone. For a game
// that wants the whole scene to take a cast -- being underwater is the
// case this was written for, where the water swallows the red and the
// green and leaves the blue.
//
// WHY RED AND GREEN SHARE A FACTOR, and it is not squeamishness about
// the API: the textured inner loop scales all three RGB565 channels with
// ONE multiply, by spreading them into separate fields of a 32-bit word
// (see scene_vrun_tex_body). One multiply cannot scale fields by
// different amounts; two can, and two is what this is. Three independent
// channels would want a third. Two is enough for water, which absorbs
// red and green far faster than blue.
//
// Free when it is off: a tint of (32, 32) restores the untinted raster
// loops, which are the same code they always were. While it is on, the
// textured path costs one extra multiply per pixel and the flat path
// nothing at all -- a flat triangle is shaded once, at setup.
void se_scene_set_tint(uint8_t rg, uint8_t b);

// Submit a world-space triangle. Projected with the current camera and
// accumulated; rasterized at scene_render(). `argb` is ARGB8888;

// sparks and the like. Projected like any vertex, so it moves correctly
// with the camera; unlit, like an edge. Depth-tested against the
// triangles (hidden behind them) but never written to the depth buffer.
// Drawn after the edges. Points behind the near plane or outside the
// viewport are dropped at submit time. A star "at infinity" is a point
// at the camera position plus a fixed direction times a large distance
// (anything up to ~30000 units still depth-tests correctly).
void scene_point(float x, float y, float z, uint32_t argb);

// --- Textured triangles -------------------------------------------------
//
// A third primitive, alongside scene_tri and scene_line (both unchanged):
// a triangle that samples a texture (se_texture.h) instead of carrying
// one flat colour. Submitted, projected and deferred the same way, into
// a list of its own, and rasterized after the flat triangles and before
// the edges, depth-tested per pixel against both. So textured and flat
// geometry occlude each other correctly in either order of submission,
// and outlines still draw over textured faces.
//
// Each vertex carries a texture coordinate (u, v) as well as its world
// position. (0, 0) is the texture's top-left corner and (1, 1) its
// bottom-right. Values outside 0..1 repeat the texture, so a plate can
// tile across a large face. Mapping is PERSPECTIVE-CORRECT: u, v are
// interpolated as u/z and v/z and divided per pixel, so a texture on a
// face seen at an angle does not swim as the face turns. Sampling is
// nearest-texel, with no filtering and no mipmaps.
//
// Lighting (se_light.h) applies exactly as it does to scene_tri: the
// same per-face shade, computed once here at submit time from the same
// world-space normal, modulates every texel of the face. Unlike a flat
// triangle, where the shade is folded into the one colour, a textured
// face keeps it as a separate factor quantised to 1/32 steps. That is
// finer than an RGB565 channel can show at full brightness anyway.
// `flags` takes the same SE_TRI_* bits as scene_tri; SE_TRI_EMISSIVE
// draws the texels unshaded.
//
// `tex` NULL drops the triangle. The texture must stay loaded until the
// frame that used it has been rasterized (see se_texture_unload).

// and touches NO framebuffer pixels — only the deferred geometry lists — so
// it is safe to run concurrently with a hardware blit that writes the
// framebuffer (e.g. a PPA backdrop composite). scene_rasterize() then paints
// the prepared geometry and must run after that blit has completed. Submit
// all geometry, call scene_prepare(), then scene_rasterize() once the
// framebuffer is ready. scene_render() is exactly these two back-to-back and
// stays the simple choice when there's nothing to overlap; the output is

// a fill loop is bound on its arithmetic or on the PSRAM its framebuffer
// and depth plane live in. Counts are per span, so they cost nothing.
// ... and the number of spans they arrived in: pixels divided by spans
// is the average run length, which is what decides whether the inner

// disappears is whatever the game happened to submit last -- a corner

// --- Camera & projection ---------------------------------------------
//
// The scene projects through a single module-global six-degree-of-freedom
// pinhole camera, set once per frame before submitting geometry. Position
// is the eye in world units; orientation is yaw / pitch / roll in radians,
// applied in that order: yaw about world-up (+y), then pitch about the
// camera's right (+x), then roll about forward (+z). At zero orientation
// the camera looks straight down +z with +y up and +x right — identical
// to the legacy fixed camera. The projection uses the RENDER_* constants
// from se_config.h (focal length / principal point — i.e. the FOV;
// overridable per game). The engine caches the rotation basis on each
// set, so the trig runs once per frame, not once per vertex.

// scene_tri / scene_line. render_set_camera_6dof() sets the full pose;

// current camera pose. At zero orientation: y = 0 is the ground plane,
// +y up, +z forward (away from the camera). Out values are in pax logical
// pixels. (scene_tri / scene_line project internally; this is for game
// code that needs to project a point itself — e.g. drawing a floor
// shadow.)
void render_project(float x_w, float y_w, float z_w, float* out_sx, float* out_sy);

// --- Viewport ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// Restrict every pixel the scene writes to a rectangle. Triangles, edges
// and the depth plane are all clipped to it, and the frustum-cull pass
// (scene_set_options) culls against it rather than against the whole
// screen, so a smaller viewport tightens culling for free.
//
// This is for a game that frames its 3D view inside a fixed border -- a
// cockpit surround, a letterbox, a split screen, a dashboard along the
// bottom. Without it, drawing the whole screen and then painting the
// border over the top pays the fill twice: once to rasterize pixels
// nobody will ever see, and again to cover them. Those pixels are
// usually the expensive ones, too -- a dashboard sits over the nearest,
// most overdrawn band of a ground-plane scene.
//
// Coordinates are pax LOGICAL pixels, the same space scene_tri projects
// into, and the rect is clamped to the framebuffer, so an oversized or
// partly-negative one is safe. An empty or inverted rect collapses to a
// single pixel: the frame goes blank, which is diagnosable, rather than
// silently drawing nothing or everything.
//
// Defaults to the whole framebuffer; passing NULL restores that. It is a
// persistent setting, NOT reset by scene_begin() -- how a game frames its
// view is a property of the game, not of the frame.
//
// It is given in full-screen pixels whatever the render scale; at
// quarter resolution (scene_set_render_scale) the engine applies it to
// the half-size target itself.
//
// The viewport clips; it does not scale or re-centre. The projection is
// still the RENDER_* pinhole about RENDER_HALF_W / RENDER_HORIZON_Y, so
// a viewport that is not centred on those shows an off-centre crop of
// the same image rather than a re-framed one. A game that wants the
// vanishing point inside its window moves it with the RENDER_* overrides
// in se_config.h.

// --- Optional render passes ------------------------------------------
//
// Two opt-in optimizations scene_render() can run before rasterizing.
// Both are OUTPUT-NEUTRAL: they change only how fast the frame is drawn,
// never the pixels, so they are always safe to toggle live (between
// frames or mid-run). Both default OFF — the engine reproduces the
// legacy pipeline exactly until a game opts in. They are independent
// features with opposite cost profiles, so measure each on its own.
//
// (Back-face culling is intentionally absent: the engine sees only
// anonymous projected triangles, whereas a game's objects know their
// face normals and can cull back faces at emit time — cheaper, and safe
// for any winding. Keep back-face culling in the game, not here.)
typedef struct {
    // Drop triangles / edges that project entirely off-screen before
    // rasterizing. Cheap O(n) screen-space test; a near-pure win when the

// --- Pluggable renderers ---------------------------------------------
//
// The built-ins are just the renderers the engine ships with; the
// pipeline itself is a seam. A game can register its own renderer
// and select it exactly like a built-in, which is the point of the
// engine being reusable: a different game with different geometry (or a
// different visual style -- cel shading, dithering, a depth-cued fog
// pass) can replace the resolve step without touching a single
// scene_tri / scene_line call site.
//
// A renderer is two callbacks mirroring scene_prepare / scene_rasterize:
//
//   prepare()    Geometry-only. May reorder, compact or index the
//                deferred lists, and build whatever acceleration
//                structure it needs. MUST NOT touch framebuffer pixels
//                -- the game is allowed to run this concurrently with a
//                hardware blit that is writing the framebuffer.
//   rasterize()  Paints. Runs after any such blit has completed.
//
// Both receive the `user` pointer given at registration. The engine's
// own cull / order passes (scene_set_options) run BEFORE prepare(), so a
// custom renderer inherits them for free and sees an already-culled list.

// targets to resolve them into. Only meaningful inside a renderer's
// prepare() / rasterize() callback.
//
// Vertices are already in screen space: sx / sy in pax logical pixels and
// w = 1/z (LARGER IS NEARER), the quantity that interpolates linearly
// across a projected triangle. A renderer that wants encoded depth
// multiplies w by `depth_scale`.
//
// The depth plane is one uint32 per pixel, (frame_stamp << 16) | depth,
// indexed exactly like `fb`: via direct_565_logical_index() from
// se_direct565.h at full resolution; at quarter resolution (`scale` 2)
// the target is half size each way, so the index is
// lx * (DISPLAY_RAW_STRIDE / 2) + (DISPLAY_RAW_W / 2 - 1 - ly). A cell counts only if its high half equals `frame`;
// anything else is a stale cell from an earlier frame and must read as
// infinitely far. This is what lets the engine skip clearing the depth
// buffer -- do not memset it, and do not assume it is zero.
//
// With SE_SCENE_DEPTH16_INTERNAL (se_config.h), a frame drawn at
// quarter resolution uses a different plane: `depth` is NULL and
// `depth16` is one uint16 depth per pixel, same index, no stamp, 0 =
// infinitely far -- the engine cleared it at scene_begin(). At full
// resolution, or without the option, `depth16` is NULL and `depth` is
